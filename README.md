# langdspy: Langchain implementation of stanford DSP

This is intended to be a langchain native implementation of the innovative principles pioneered by the wonderful [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)

I believe that the principles they have pioneered should be built on top of more mature primitives with a larger ecosystem & community to support it.

This is intended to be usable in production enterprise environments.
